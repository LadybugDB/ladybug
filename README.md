# Ladybug
Ladybug is an embedded graph database built for query speed and scalability. Ladybug is optimized for handling complex analytical workloads
on very large databases and provides a set of retrieval features, such as a full text search and vector indices. Our core feature set includes:

- Flexible Property Graph Data Model and Cypher query language
- Embeddable, serverless integration into applications
- Native full text search and vector index
- Columnar disk-based storage
- Columnar sparse row-based (CSR) adjacency list/join indices
- Vectorized and factorized query processor
- Novel and very fast join algorithms
- Multi-core query parallelism
- Serializable ACID transactions
- Wasm (WebAssembly) bindings for fast, secure execution in the browser

Ladybug is being developed by [LadybugDB Developers](https://github.com/LadybugDB) and
is available under a permissible license. So try it out and help us make it better! We welcome your feedback and feature requests.

The database was formerly known as [Kuzu](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu).
